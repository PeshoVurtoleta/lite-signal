## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- `markDownstream` iterative DFS marker backed by preallocated `markStack` — propagation no longer grows the JS call stack regardless of graph depth.
- Double-buffered effect queue (`effectQueueA` / `effectQueueB`) — effects scheduled mid-flush land in the next pass, no recursive flush.
- Generation counter (`gen`) per node — stale handles after dispose+recycle silently no-op instead of corrupting the pool.
- `CapacityError` with `kind` (`"nodes"` | `"links"`) and `capacity` fields, thrown when the `"throw"` policy is set and a pool is exhausted.
- `createRegistry({ onCapacityExceeded: "grow" })` — opt-in unbounded pool growth, bounded by `maxLinks * 16` ceiling.
- `createRegistry({ maxFlushPasses })` — configurable cycle-protection limit (default `100`).
- `destroy()` — full registry reset; all prior handles silently no-op afterward.
- `watch(source, callback, { immediate? })`, `when(predicate, callback)`, `whenAsync(predicate)` — re-exported from `Watch.js`. Zero-allocation hot paths in `watch` and `when`; `whenAsync` allocates one Promise per call (documented; not for per-frame use).

### Changed
- 32-bit modular epoch arithmetic across `globalVersion`, `evalVersion`, `markEpoch`. Engine survives indefinite uptime without integer-overflow risk.
- `dispose(api)` is now universal across signals, computeds, effect handles, and `.subscribe()` return values. Cross-registry calls are silent no-ops. Foreign reactive primitives are duck-typed (on `.peek`) and not invoked.
- `untrack(fn)` restores prior tracking state via `try / finally` — safe under thrown errors inside `fn`.
- `onCleanup(fn)` now accepts multiple registrations per scope and works in computeds, not just effects. Stored as a single function or upgraded to an array.

### Fixed
- Diamond dependency reads no longer over-fire effects (versioned pull resolves convergence cleanly in one pass).
- Effect re-runs no longer leak link slots when the dep set shrinks (tail-link severance in `severTail`).
- Disposed-then-recycled slots no longer mis-dispose under stale handles (generation guard in `dispose`).
- Cleanup functions registered inside computeds now fire (previously effect-only).

### Performance
- Steady-state hot path: **0 allocations** across `signal.set`, `signal.peek`, computed read, effect re-run, dispose.
- **249K ops/s** on MUX fan-in (Node 22, 2016 MacBook Pro). +20% vs alien-signals on identical workload.
- **15 KB** transient heap across 20,000 iterations.
- Full methodology and reproducibility recipe in [`bench/README.md`](./bench/README.md).

### Known limitations
- Dependency reconciliation is O(1) per read on stable read order; degrades to O(N) under chaotic read order. v1.2 (in benchmark validation) replaces the cursor-based retracking with per-source version-stamped reconciliation — see [RFC #N1](https://github.com/PeshoVurtoleta/lite-signal/issues/1).
- Computed resolution is recursive on the JS call stack; bounded by the engine stack limit (~10,000 frames).
- `whenAsync` allocates one Promise per call. Use `when` (callback form) for per-frame paths.

### Migration from 1.0.x
